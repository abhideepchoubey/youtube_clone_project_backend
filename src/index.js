//the difference between dependencies and devDependencies is that dependencies are the packages required for
//the application to run in production, while devDependencies are the packages needed only during development and testing.
//For example, a web framework like Express would be a dependency, while a testing library like Mocha would be a devDependency.
//in short, dependencies are essential for the app's functionality, while devDependencies are essential for development tasks.

//by placeholder file, i mean a file that is created to hold a place in a directory structure, often to ensure that the directory is included in version control systems like Git.
//These files are typically empty or contain minimal content, and their primary purpose is to prevent the directory from being ignored or deleted when the project is shared or deployed.
//For example, a common placeholder file is named .gitkeep, which is used to keep an otherwise empty directory in a Git repository.
